### **Mailchimp List Structure**  
You'll have **separate lists** for:  
✅ **Patrons** (newsletter subscribers)  
✅ **Donors** (people who contributed)  
✅ **Volunteers** (people helping the theater)  
🔍 **Others?** – You’ll confirm with the board  

### **Key Features & API Usage**  

| **Feature** | **How It Works** | **Mailchimp API Endpoint** |
|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **User Subscribes via Form** | Form submission adds them to the correct list | `POST /lists/{list_id}/members` |
| **Admin Manages Members** | Add, edit, remove members from the site | `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE /lists/{list_id}/members/{subscriber_hash}` |
| **Admin Views Lists & Members** | Pulls lists and members for display | `GET /lists` + `GET /lists/{list_id}/members` |
| **Automated Show Reminders** | Webhooks trigger emails for ticket buyers | `POST /automations` |
| **Donor Thank-You Emails** | Auto-send when donation received | `POST /automations` |
| **Welcome Emails** | Auto-send on subscription | `POST /automations` |
| **Admin Sends Emails** | Create/schedule campaigns from the admin panel | `POST /campaigns` |

### **Ticket Purchase & Mailing List Interaction**  

Since you don’t want to auto-add ticket buyers to the mailing list, the best approach is:  
1. **At checkout**, include a checkbox: ✅ *Join our mailing list?*  
2. If checked, add them to the **Patrons list**.  
3. If not checked, **store their email in your DB** under "Bought Tix (Not on List)" in case they subscribe later.  

➡ **Optional:**  
- You could send **reminder emails** to non-subscribers saying, *“Enjoyed the show? Stay updated on future performances!”*

### **Real-Time vs Periodic Sync**  

- **Real-Time Sync** (Webhook-based)  
  - **Example:** A donor makes a contribution → Mailchimp sends a **webhook** → Laravel updates local DB and sends a thank-you email.  
  - **Best for:** Keeping everything instantly updated.  
  - **Downside:** Can require more API calls if you’re syncing a lot of data.  

- **Periodic Sync** (Scheduled Updates)  
  - **Example:** A Laravel **cron job** runs every 30 minutes to check for new members in Mailchimp and update your database.  
  - **Best for:** Reducing API calls.  
  - **Downside:** Not always up-to-date immediately.  

For your case:  
✅ **Use webhooks** for instant updates (like ticket purchases triggering show reminders).  
✅ **Use periodic sync** for admin tools (like updating the local database with Mailchimp members once a day).

### **Next Steps**  
1. **Confirm Lists:** Once the board finalizes the mailing lists, we can define API calls.  
2. **Set Up Webhooks:** Decide which events (donations, ticket sales, etc.) should trigger automatic emails.  
3. **Admin Panel UI:** Mock up how admins will manage lists & send emails.
