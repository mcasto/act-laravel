### **How to Tie the Site to Mailchimp (API Overview)**  
Your website will interact with Mailchimp in these ways:  

#### **1. Storing Mailchimp Data in Your Database**  
You’ll need **two tables** in your database:  
- **`mailchimp_lists`** – Stores lists (audiences) and their Mailchimp `list_id`.  
- **`mailchimp_members`** – Stores members linked to lists, with `subscriber_hash` for API requests.  

#### **2. User Signup & List Management**  
- A **signup form** on your site lets users subscribe.  
- Their email gets hashed (`subscriber_hash`) and added to Mailchimp.  
- Their record is also stored in `mailchimp_members`.  

#### **3. Ticket Purchases & Automated Emails**  
- When someone buys a ticket, the site:  
  - **Adds them to the Mailchimp list** (if not already there).  
  - **Tags them** with the show they purchased.  
  - **Triggers an automated email** (e.g., confirmation, reminders).  

#### **4. Admin Controls**  
- View lists and members from `mailchimp_lists` and `mailchimp_members`.  
- Add/edit/remove members.  
- Sync updates with Mailchimp.  
- Send emails via Mailchimp API (or direct users to Mailchimp's campaign tool).  

#### **5. Handling Unsubscribes**  
- If a user unsubscribes in Mailchimp, a **webhook updates your database**.  
- If an admin removes a user from your site, the API **removes them from Mailchimp**.

### **Site Interactions (Visitor & Admin)**  
| **User Role** | **Action** | **API Endpoint** |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Visitor | Subscribe to mailing list | `POST /lists/{list_id}/members` |
| Visitor | Buy ticket → Auto-add to list | `POST /lists/{list_id}/members` + `PATCH` (add tags) |
| Visitor | Unsubscribe | `PATCH /lists/{list_id}/members/{subscriber_hash}` (status: `"unsubscribed"`) |
| Admin | View mailing lists | `GET /lists` |
| Admin | View members | `GET /lists/{list_id}/members` |
| Admin | Add/edit/delete members | `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE /lists/{list_id}/members/{subscriber_hash}` |
| Admin | Send email to a list | (Either via Mailchimp Campaigns or direct API call) |

### **Next Steps**  
1. Do you prefer **separate lists or one list with tags**?
