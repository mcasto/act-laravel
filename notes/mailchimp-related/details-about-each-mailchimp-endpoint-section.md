That sounds like a great use of Mailchimp! Here’s a breakdown based on your questions:

### **1. Lists/Audiences**
Yes, in Mailchimp, a **list (audience)** is a collection of subscribers. For your community theater, you might have:
- **Patrons**: People who have bought tickets or signed up for show updates.
- **Donors**: People who have contributed financially.
- **Volunteers**: Those interested in helping out with productions.
- **Press & Media**: Journalists and bloggers interested in covering your shows.

Each audience can have **segments**—for example, the “Patrons” list could be divided into “Season Ticket Holders” and “Single Ticket Buyers.” If you want to keep things simple, you could use **one** audience and segment it instead of creating multiple lists.

---

### **2. Members**
Yes, **members** are the individual subscribers within an audience. Each has details like:
- Email address (required)
- Name
- Subscription status (Subscribed, Unsubscribed, etc.)
- Tags (e.g., “VIP Donor,” “Frequent Attendee”)
- Custom fields (e.g., favorite show, ticket purchase history)

---

### **3. Campaigns**
You’re right that **campaigns** are often associated with marketing, but in Mailchimp, they are just **emails that you send out**. Your **newsletters about shows and events** would be considered campaigns. You can:
- Send a one-time campaign (e.g., "Announcing Next Season’s Shows").
- Schedule campaigns in advance.
- Use A/B testing to see which email version gets more engagement.

If you don’t need fancy marketing strategies, you **can still use campaigns to send regular updates**.

### **4. Automations**
**Automations** are emails triggered by certain actions or time-based schedules. For a theater, you could use them to:
- **Welcome New Subscribers**: When someone joins your mailing list, they automatically receive a welcome email with a discount code or show schedule.
- **Post-Show Follow-Ups**: A day after someone attends a performance, they get an email asking for feedback or suggesting an upcoming show.
- **Donation Thank Yous**: When a donor contributes, they automatically get a personalized thank-you email.
- **Abandoned Ticket Purchase Reminders**: If Mailchimp is integrated with ticket sales, you could send reminders to people who started buying tickets but didn’t complete their purchase.
- **Birthday Offers**: If you collect birthdays, you could send discount codes for their birthday month.

You don’t *need* automations, but they can make certain communications easier and more consistent.

### **5. Templates**
**Templates** help create reusable email designs so that each newsletter doesn’t need to be built from scratch. Mailchimp provides:
- **Pre-designed templates** (drag-and-drop editor)
- **Custom HTML templates** (if you want to code your own)
- **Saved templates** (if you create a design and want to use it repeatedly)

For your theater, you might create templates for:
- **Show Announcements**: A standard layout with an image, show details, and a "Buy Tickets" button.
- **Event Reminders**: Quick updates for special events like opening night.
- **Monthly Newsletters**: A template with sections for upcoming shows, behind-the-scenes content, and community updates.

---

### **6. E-Commerce**
Mailchimp does **not** process payments directly, but it integrates with platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, and Eventbrite. The **E-commerce section** is useful for:
- Tracking sales from emails (e.g., if you link to a ticketing site, you can see how many tickets were sold via your emails).
- Sending **abandoned cart reminders** if you sell tickets online.
- Recommending products (or shows) based on past purchases.

For a **theater**, this might not be essential unless you sell merchandise or process ticket sales through a connected platform.

---

### **7. Webhooks**
**Webhooks** allow Mailchimp to send real-time updates to your website or app when something happens in your mailing list. For example:
- **New Subscriber Alert**: If someone signs up for your newsletter, your website could automatically update a "Total Subscribers" counter.
- **Unsubscribe Handling**: If someone unsubscribes, your website could remove their access to special content.
- **Donation Confirmation Emails**: If someone donates and is added to a "Donors" list, a webhook could trigger an automatic thank-you message from your website.
- **Event Reminder Sync**: If a member registers for an event and gets tagged in Mailchimp, your website could automatically update their profile.

Webhooks are great if you want **real-time updates** between your website and Mailchimp.

---

### **Summary**
- **Lists (Audiences)**: Organize different types of subscribers (patrons, donors, etc.).
- **Members**: The actual people in each list.
- **Campaigns**: Your newsletters and updates.
- **Automations**: Auto-sent emails triggered by events.
- **Templates**: Reusable email designs.
- **E-Commerce**: Helps track sales and marketing, but not essential unless you sell merchandise.
- **Webhooks**: Sync Mailchimp with your website for real-time updates.
