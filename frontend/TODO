☐ modify update performances so it will actually delete performances
☐ modify so performances can be tentative (should only have 1 performance record & should only display the month/year)

--- Legacy, not sure which of these are still valid ---

☐ Set up Join Mailing List

☐ add an "audition" button to admin/edit-show to allow admin to set audition information for that show

☐ add a method (used route.meta.conditional for this for audition button) to determine if audition & classes buttons should be disabled (or possibly not visible, I think disabled makes more sense with a tooltip that says "none currently available" type of text)

☐ fixr setup
    - no need to set up a separate fixr event for each performance ... we'll know which performance(s) they're paying for based on the info we collect on our site (shopping cart)

☐ add fixr link to show record

☐ audition roster in admin area

☐ add class management (with enrolled) to admin area
    payment methods for enrollment?
