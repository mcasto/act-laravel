      Who We Are
    </div>
    <div class="q-gutter-y-sm">
      <p>
        Azuay Community Theater (ACT) is an all-volunteer company dedicated to
        bringing quality, live performance, with an emphasis on theater to
        Cuenca, Ecuador.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to serve our patrons, our players, and other volunteers.
      </p>
      <p>
        For our patrons, we strive to provide top quality productions that would
        otherwise not be available to the Cuenca community, with an emphasis on
        English language theater.
      </p>
      <p>
        For our performers and technicians, we make available an ever improving
        environment to learn and hone theatrical skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        We give our volunteers an opportunity to participate in the broad range
        of activities required to maintain and promote an established, full
        production regional theater.

      History
    </div>
    <div class="q-gutter-y-sm">
      <p>
        Founded in 2014, ACT's initial productions were rehearsed in members'
        living rooms and presented in various restaurants and meeting facilities
        throughout the city. In April 2018, ACT obtained a permanent, beautiful
        home in an event auditorium originally constructed as part of a complex
        adjacent to the Hotel Oro Verde on Cuenca's Avenida Ordoñez Lasso.
      </p>
      <p>
        We expanded its stage and improved its sound and lights, and there we
        produced a wide range of plays and hosted other top class events like
        local music acts and magic shows. In December of 2022, we lost our lease
        on Ordoñez Lasso and began a search for another permanent home during
        which we located a space on Juan Montalvo that served as a storage and
        rehearsal location for several months.
      </p>
      <p>
        The global COVID-19 epidemic forced ACT to go dark during 2020 and 2021.
        With our 2022-23 season, however, we rebounded with a schedule of five
        full productions through August 2023 which you can view on our Gallery
        page.
