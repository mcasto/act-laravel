<div class="text-h6">So, you want to act?</div>
<p>
  But you wonder if you have what it takes (or if you still have it). Good news.
  You do.
</p>
<p>
  Acting is the art of being human&mdash;fully and completely. It's nothing more
  than that. Emotional honesty communicated between the members of a cast and to
  an audience.
</p>
<p>
  You've been "humaning" for a while, right? Feeling feelings? Emoting emotions?
  Then you've got what you need. Emotions, a body, a bit of courage (which is a
  learned skill, not something you're "born with"), and you're ready to start.
</p>
<p>
  The rest is just skills. I can teach you those. It's not easy, but it's
  definitely doable. In eight lessos. Two hours each. Dress to move. Be ready to
  sweat a bit, maybe cry a bit. Think quite a bit.
</p>
<p>
  Bring a pen and a notebook. You're going to want to write some of this down.
