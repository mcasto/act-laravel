  Did you know that our ticket sales only cover 70% of our operating costs to
  bring you our six show season? Bar sales and 50/50 tickets sales help, but
  your contribution as an ACT Angel will allow us to keep bringing you our great
  entertainment and continue to improve our theater for your enjoyment.
